- Projects done during my study of Harvard University's [cs50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/block-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X+type@sequential+block@3c550787b1d1470bbdba91d14392bd43/block-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X+type@vertical+block@ffc346411661409a901306ca7c2b7b54), an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. 

## Technologies
- Files written in ```Visual Studio Code 1.73``` editor. 
- C files compiled using ```gcc 9.4.0```.
- C files wriiten according to the betty coding style. 
- Files tested on ```Windows 10``` using ```gcc```.
